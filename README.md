# Real-world Data Wrangling Project

## Project Overview

In this project, i gathered and wrangled real-world data using two datasets. The main tasks include:

1. Retrieving and extracting the data.
2. Assessing the data programmatically and visually for quality and structure.
3. Implementing a cleaning strategy for the data.
4. Storing the updated data into a selected database or data store.
5. Combining the data and answering a research question using the datasets.


## Getting Started

1. **Data Gathering:** Collect the data from various sources and ensure it is in a usable format.
2. **Data Assessment:** Programmatically and visually assess the data for quality and structure issues.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Develop and implement a cleaning strategy to address the identified issues.
4. **Data Storage:** Store the cleaned data in your preferred database or data store.
5. **Data Analysis:** Combine the datasets and perform analysis to answer the research question.

## Project Structure

- **Data Gathering:** Scripts and methods for collecting and loading data.
- **Data Assessment:** Techniques and tools used for assessing the data quality and structure.
- **Data Cleaning:** Processes and functions implemented to clean the data.
- **Data Storage:** Details on how and where the cleaned data is stored.
- **Data Analysis:** Insights and answers derived from the data.
